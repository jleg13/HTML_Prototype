This project was to produce an HTML prototype design using Bootstrap to layout a restaurant booking application that can be made into a full stack application. Here is the code for the [Express Server](https://github.com/jleg13/MERN_Application) for the developed application, and here is the code for the whole fullstack application with the Vue.js [front-end](https://github.com/jleg13/MEVN_Application).

# How to use the starter code

- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on your machine.
- In the terminal, run the command `docker-compose up -d` or `docker compose up -d` in the `a1_starter` directory.
- Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in Firefox.
- If you see the followings, the starter code is working:
	- The navbar
	- The h1 `Homepage`
	- `Column 1` in red, `Column 2` and `Column 3` in black.
	- `Hello world!!!` in the console
- Now, you are ready to write your own code!
